This is a personal website made to be used as a link to my resume. There is a database being used in the background.
This database stores UNIQUE usernames, and with each username is a password. Each user may or may not 
store sticky notes which can be added and deleted. These sticky notes are UNIQUE to each account and are saved 
upon login. There is an admin page "/test_db" which can be hidden if this website were to ever be put online, and 
this admin page stores all of each users info and which notes they own, as well as what is on each note.
